The Carbon Suite
=========
Could we yet do something? Or shall we just dance away the hour until the world runs down?

Idea and theme connection
======
This is a rhythm game. I came into the weekend wanting to write a waltz. The theme  made me think about the world as possibly in danger from climate change and nuclear war, and how small and fragile it is (from that point of view). Then I remembered stories of the Titanic's band continuing to play as the ship went down ... so that is my game idea. One last waltz as the world sinks.

Inspiration
=======
I wanted the game to have an "arcade" feel, and I almost totally failed at that. Super Hexagon is one of my favorite games, and the feelings I have when I play it remind me of swing dancing. I was aiming to re-create that feeling through my game, but the control scheme ended up being too fiddly. I think that by making the gameplay too much like real dancing I painted myself into a corner ... a tap-based rhythm game. And there is a reason I don't really like those types of games. If I were to do this again I'd spend a lot more time brainstorming control schemes. While I did a good job of idea generation after receiving the theme, and not settling too early, I failed to do the same with the control scheme.

Voting Category Opt-outs
========

Code, art, music were all written by me, so no opt-outs. I used the Great Vibes font, but I believe that is permitted.
